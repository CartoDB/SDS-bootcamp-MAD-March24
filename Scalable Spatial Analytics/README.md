# Scalable Spatial Analytics

This repository contains the material for the workshop _Scalable Spatial Analytics_. It includes:

- A [guide](https://github.com/CartoDB/SDS-bootcamp-MAD-March24/blob/master/Scalable%20Spatial%20Analytics/%5BSDS%20Bootcamp%20-%20Madrid%2020240320%5D%20Scalable%20spatial%20analytics.pdf) that helps attendees follow along during the session and can also be used later on to recreate the analysis.
- Three workflows that will be used during the session in the following order:
  - [Analyzing cell tower data](https://github.com/CartoDB/SDS-bootcamp-MAD-March24/blob/master/Scalable%20Spatial%20Analytics/%5BSDS%20Bootcamp%20Madrid%5D%20-%20Analyzing%20cell%20tower%20data.sql)
  - [Preparing external data](https://github.com/CartoDB/SDS-bootcamp-MAD-March24/blob/master/Scalable%20Spatial%20Analytics/%5BSDS%20Bootcamp%20Madrid%5D%20-%20Preparing%20external%20data.sql)
  - [Why are antennas placed at specific locations](https://github.com/CartoDB/SDS-bootcamp-MAD-March24/blob/master/Scalable%20Spatial%20Analytics/%5BSDS%20Bootcamp%20Madrid%5D%20-%20Why%20are%20antennas%20placed%20at%20specific%20locations_.sql)
